The breadcrumbs component is used to display where the user is in the application at the moment and to provide an easy way to navigate back to the parent pages.

### Usage

Simply provide all the links as children, in the order they are supposed to be rendered.

#### Example

```jsx
<Breadcrumbs>
  <a href="#">Studies</a>
  <a href="#">New Study</a>
  <span>New Patient</span>
</Breadcrumbs>
```
